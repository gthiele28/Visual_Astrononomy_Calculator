As far as I'm aware, distributing the .exe for chromedriver like this is
acceptable legally and secure for users, but if I'm wrong I'd have no 
issue removing it

NOTE: This driver is only compatible with Chrome V142 on Apple ARM64 CPUS,
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS INSTALL THE CORRECT VERSION AND DRAG THE
EXTRACTED DOWNLOAD INTO THE FOLDER AS IT IS HERE, AND DELETE THIS ONE!!!
